    - Welcome to your first assignment. You must first locate the tumor deep in this
      part of the facility. You may need to pass some security barriers. I am sure
      you can be recourceful enough for such a challenge.
    - 'The original residents here are long gone due to a contamination breach. The
      ones that did not escape were "repurposed" by the bioweapon that broke containment.
      These "zombies", for lack of a better term, are blind but not deaf. '
    - They wait and listen for disturbances as they guard the tumor. Guns are only
      a last resort when you need them. Your blade should be sufficient enough to
      dispach them quietly.
    - Once you get to the tumor, plant 3 explosive charges which I already provided
      to you. Place 1 at the tumor, and the other 2 on the walls on either side.
    - I will speak to you again when you prime the charges. Good luck. You may need
      it here.
  - messages:
    - The scanners now have detected those 3 charges you primed. Now get the hell
      back to where you came. Once you leave, the charges will detonate and our work
      is done.
